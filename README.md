*ingredients
** 2 gallons cow or goat milk (do not use UHT/UP milk)
** 1/8 tsp. calcium chloride diluted in 1/4 cup water (optional)
** Mesophilic culture (choose one):
** 1 packet direct-set mesophilic culture
** 1/8 tsp. bulk mesophilic culture
** Rennet, dissolved in 1/2 cup cool water (choose one):
** 1/2 tsp. liquid animal rennet or
** 1/4 tsp. double-strength liquid rennet or
** 1/4 tablet vegetable rennet
** 2 Tbsp. sea salt


*In a large pot, heat the milk to 85°F, stirring frequently.*
*As the milk is heating, add the calcium chloride, if using.*
*When the milk gets to 85°F, add culture, stir in with an up-and-down motion, cover, and ferment for 1 hour. (Note: It does not have to stay at 85. If it naturally drops in temperature, that is OK.)*
*Stir to homogenize the milk, and slowly fold in the diluted rennet. Using an up-and-down motion with your spoon will ensure that the rennet works its way through all the milk, so you can get the highest possible yield.*
*Remove from heat source and allow the cheese to set for 1 hour, or until the whey begins to separate from the curd. You should see a layer of mostly clear whey floating on top of the curd, and the curd should be pulling away from the sides of the pot.*
*Using the knife, carefully cut the curds into ¼-inch cubes and allow to set for 5 minutes. Do not stir.*
*Over the next 30 minutes, slowly heat the curds to 100°F, stirring frequently. As you stir, the curds will shrink.*
*Once the curds are at 100°F, maintain the temperature and continue stirring for the next 30 minutes. If the curds get too hot, remove from heat.*
*After 30 minutes, stop stirring and allow the curds to settle to the bottom of the pot. This will take about 20 minutes.*
*Pour the curds into a colander. Place the colander and curds back into the cheese pot and allow to drain for 15 minutes.*
*Remove the colander from the pot and turn the curds out onto a cutting board. You should have a semi-solid mass that looks like jelly. Pour the whey out of the pot, cut the mass into five slices, and place back into the pot. Cover.*
*Fill a sink or basin with 102°F water and place the pot and curds into it. Keeping the temperature of the curds right around 100°F, turn the slices every 15 minutes for the next 2 hours. This is the cheddaring process and will give your cheese its unique flavor and deliciousness.*
*After 2 hours, the curds will be shiny and very firm. Remove them from the pot and cut into ½-inch cubes. Place back in the pot, cover, and place in the sink filled with 102°F water.*
*In 10 minutes, stir gently with your fingers or a wooden spoon. Repeat twice more.*
*Remove the pot from the sink and add salt. Stir gently once more.*
*Line the cheese press with a piece of cheesecloth and carefully place the curds into the press. Wrap the cloth around the cheese andpress at 10 pounds of pressure for 15 minutes.*
*Remove the cheese from the press, unwrap, and flip the cheese. Re-wrap using a fresh piece of cheesecloth, and press at 40 pounds of pressure for 12 hours.*
*Remove the cheese from the press, unwrap, and flip the cheese. Re-wrap using a fresh piece of cheesecloth, and press at 50 pounds of pressure for 24 hours.*
*Remove the cheese from the press and air-dry for 2 to 3 days, until smooth and dry to the touch.*
*Wax the cheese and age at 55° to 60°F for at least 60 days. (Click here for practical methods for aging cheese.)*
